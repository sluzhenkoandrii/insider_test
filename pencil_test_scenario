Functional Testing
1. Verify the pencil can write smoothly on standard paper.

2. Verify the pencil leaves a consistent and visible mark.

3. Verify the eraser can erase pencil marks effectively.

4. Verify that writing with the pencil does not cause the lead to break under normal pressure.

5. Verify that the eraser does not damage the paper when used properly.

Usability Testing
1. Verify the pencil is comfortable to hold for different hand sizes.

2. Verify that the pencilâ€™s weight feels balanced and appropriate.

3. Verify the eraser is easy to use without excessive force.

4. Verify the pencil design (e.g., shape, texture) prevents slipping during use.

Performance Testing
1. Measure how many pages the pencil can write on before becoming too short to use.

2. Measure how many erasures the eraser can perform before wearing down completely.

3. Check how the writing quality changes as the pencil becomes dull.

Load Testing
1. Test writing continuously for a long period to check if the pencil maintains performance.

2. Test continuous erasing for a long period to assess the durability of the eraser.

Stress Testing
1. Apply excessive pressure to see at what point the pencil lead breaks.

2. Use the eraser aggressively to see how much force it can handle before detaching or crumbling.

3. Drop the pencil from different heights to verify if it survives impact without breaking.

Security Testing
1. Verify the pencil is non-toxic and safe for use (materials safety).

2. Verify the pencil does not have sharp edges that could injure the user.

3. Verify the eraser is securely attached and cannot be easily swallowed by small children.

Compatibility Testing
1. Test writing on different types of surfaces (standard paper, recycled paper, cardboard).

2. Test erasing marks from different surfaces to check effectiveness.

Environmental Testing
1. Test the pencil in different temperatures (cold, hot) to check for material degradation.

2. Test how humidity affects writing or erasing quality.

3. Test exposure to water (light rain) to check if materials are resistant.
